Logging Service:

This service should expose an API that other services can use to send their logs.
The logs could be stored in a database or a distributed file system for durability and easy access. You might want to consider using a time-series database or a log management system for this purpose.
The service could also provide functionalities for querying and visualizing the logs. This can be useful for debugging and monitoring the health of your system.

Other Services:
Each service in your system should be modified to send its logs to the Logging Service. This could be done asynchronously to avoid impacting the performance of the services.
The logs should include useful information such as the timestamp, the name of the service, the log level (e.g., info, warning, error), and the log message. They could also include other context-specific information.

Considerations:
You might want to consider using a logging framework or library that supports structured logging and log levels.
For sensitive data, ensure that no sensitive information (like passwords or personally identifiable information) is included in the logs.
Depending on your requirements, you might also want to consider implementing log rotation and retention policies.
